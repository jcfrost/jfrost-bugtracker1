<h3>@ViewBag.Message</h3>

<p>This project was created during weeks 4-6 of my coding boot camp.</p>
<p>I used Microsoft Visual Studio, MVC, Microsoft Code-First database schema using Entity Framework with user- and role-level security, LINQ, C#, and web pages built with HTML5, Bootstrap and model binding with Razor.</p>
<p>This project was my first exposure most of these technologies and my first effort creating and using an SQL database.</p>
<br />
<p>Please read my Blog entries and contact me if you have any questions about what I am doing or anything that I have done.</p>
